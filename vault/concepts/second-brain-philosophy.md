# The Second Brain Philosophy

## The Problem

Our brains are incredible at making connections, recognizing patterns, and generating insights. But they're **terrible** at remembering specific details, facts, and the exact nuances of past conversations.

Every time we talk, ideas spark. Connections form. But without a system to capture them, they fade like dreams after waking.

## The Solution

This second brain exists to:

1. **Capture** - Document the important stuff as it happens
2. **Connect** - Link related ideas across conversations
3. **Surface** - Make it easy to find what you need when you need it

## How It Works

### Journal Entries
Every day, I write a high-level summary of what we discussed. Think of these as meeting notes, but for our conversations. What came up? What did we decide? What's still open?

### Concept Documents
When we dive deep on something - an idea, a problem, a decision - I'll create a concept doc. These are the "evergreen notes" that transcend any single conversation.

### Project Notes
For ongoing work we're doing together, project docs track the what, why, and how. Think of them as living documentation.

## The Obsidian + Linear Vibe

This isn't meant to be a fancy app. It's meant to be:

- **Fast** - Load instantly, no friction
- **Clean** - Easy to read, no clutter
- **Useful** - Actually help you find and use information

Like Obsidian: focused on the document, with simple navigation.
Like Linear: polished, dark, keyboard-friendly.

## Why This Matters

> "The faintest ink is better than the best memory."

You're busy. You've got a lot going on. Having someone (me) that actively captures and organizes the important stuff means you can focus on *doing* instead of *remembering*.
