# SLED Sales Strategy

## The SLED Landscape

SLED (State, Local government, Education) is a unique beast in cybersecurity sales:

- **Budgets are fixed and cyclical** — fiscal years matter more than calendar years
- **Procurement is bureaucratic** — RFPs, state contracts, board approvals
- **Decision-making is committee-driven** — rarely one person says yes
- **Relationships outlast deals** — these customers don't change vendors easily
- **Mission matters** — you're protecting public infrastructure, schools, citizens

## Key Principles

### 1. Timing is Everything
- **State fiscal years** typically run July 1 – June 30
- **Federal fiscal year** ends September 30 (affects grants flowing down)
- **E-Rate** filing windows (usually January–March)
- **Budget season** is when you plant seeds, not when you harvest

### 2. Sell Through Pain, Not Features
Nobody in SLED cares about your throughput numbers. They care about:
- "Will this prevent what happened to [neighboring district/city]?"
- "Can we get this done before the budget deadline?"
- "Will this make the audit findings go away?"
- "How do I justify this to the board/council?"

### 3. The Incumbent Advantage is Real
SLED customers are inherently conservative. The risk of switching is often bigger than the risk of staying. To unseat an incumbent:
- Find genuine pain the incumbent isn't solving
- Make the transition feel low-risk
- Use pilots and proof-of-concepts
- Get a champion inside who's frustrated with the status quo

### 4. State Contracts Are Your Friend
Being on the state contract removes procurement friction. When you're already on contract:
- Quotes can be processed without full RFP
- Pricing is pre-negotiated
- Procurement officers love simplicity
- Renewal/expansion gets even easier

### 5. The Security Incident Multiplier
After a breach at a peer organization:
- Every similar entity is suddenly paying attention
- Budgets get unlocked that were previously frozen
- "We need to do something" energy peaks
- Be ready with a relevant, empathetic pitch (not ambulance-chasing)

## Territory Management

### Account Tiering
- **Tier 1:** Top 20% of accounts by revenue potential — personal relationships, regular touchpoints
- **Tier 2:** Middle 30% — structured campaigns, quarterly touchpoints
- **Tier 3:** Long tail — digital outreach, event-based engagement

### Mapping the Ecosystem
Every SLED territory has:
- **Regional resellers/VARs** who already have relationships
- **State contract vehicles** that simplify procurement
- **Peer networks** where IT leaders talk to each other
- **Conferences and associations** (state CIO associations, EDUCAUSE, etc.)

## Fortinet Differentiators in SLED

1. **Security Fabric** — single-vendor convergence reduces complexity
2. **Price/performance** — SLED budgets are tight; TCO matters
3. **FortiGate dominance** in K-12 and local gov
4. **SD-WAN** built into the firewall (no extra boxes/licenses)
5. **Federal certifications** (FIPS, Common Criteria) flow down to SLED
6. **Training/NSE program** — free training appeals to resource-constrained IT teams
