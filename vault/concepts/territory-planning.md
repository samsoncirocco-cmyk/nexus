## Account Tiering

Not all accounts are equal. Tier them ruthlessly.

### Tier 1 — "Must Win" (Top 10-15 accounts)
- Highest revenue potential
- Active opportunity or strong relationship
- Strategic value (reference accounts, large footprint)
- **Time allocation:** 50-60% of selling time
- **Cadence:** Weekly touches, monthly face-to-face

### Tier 2 — "Should Win" (Next 20-30 accounts)
- Good potential, need development
- Some existing Fortinet footprint or known pain
- **Time allocation:** 25-30% of selling time
- **Cadence:** Bi-weekly touches, quarterly face-to-face

### Tier 3 — "Could Win" (Remaining territory)
- Long-term potential
- No active engagement yet
- **Time allocation:** 10-15% of selling time
- **Cadence:** Monthly nurture, event invitations

### Tiering Criteria Scorecard

Score each account 1-5:

| Factor | Weight | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Revenue potential | 25% | |
| Current Fortinet footprint | 20% | |
| Relationship strength | 20% | |
| Budget availability | 15% | |
| Competitive vulnerability | 10% | |
| Strategic value | 10% | |
| **Weighted Total** | | |

- **Score 4.0+** → Tier 1
- **Score 2.5-3.9** → Tier 2
- **Score < 2.5** → Tier 3

## Weekly Rhythm

### Monday — Plan the Week
- Review pipeline: what moved, what's stuck, what's at risk
- Check calendar for upcoming meetings
- Identify 3-5 must-do actions for the week
- Update CRM with any weekend insights

### Tuesday-Thursday — Execute
- Customer meetings, demos, discovery calls
- Follow-ups from previous meetings
- Prospecting blocks (min 1 hour/day)
- Internal syncs (SE, channel, leadership)

### Friday — Close the Week
- CRM hygiene: update all active opps
- Send follow-ups for anything outstanding
- Plan next week's priorities
- Win/loss analysis for any deals that closed

---

## Quarterly Territory Review

### Beginning of Quarter
1. **Refresh account tiers** based on last quarter's results
2. **Set pipeline targets** — need 3-4x coverage by mid-quarter
3. **Identify whitespace** — accounts with no Fortinet footprint
4. **Map fiscal calendars** — which accounts have budget this quarter?
5. **Plan events/campaigns** — what's the hook this quarter?

### Mid-Quarter Check
1. **Pipeline health** — on track for coverage?
2. **Deal velocity** — anything stalled that needs intervention?
3. **Tier 1 status** — are you winning the must-wins?
4. **Course correct** — shift time to where deals are moving

### End of Quarter
1. **Close hard** — focus on committed and upside deals
2. **Push or pull** — be honest about what's real for this quarter
3. **Seed next quarter** — don't go dark on prospecting
4. **Win/loss review** — what worked, what didn't

## SLED-Specific Planning

### Budget Cycles to Track

| Segment | Typical FY | Budget Season | Best Selling Window |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| State (most) | Jul 1 - Jun 30 | Jan-May | Sep-Mar |
| K-12 | Jul 1 - Jun 30 | Feb-May | Sep-Mar |
| Higher Ed | Jul 1 - Jun 30 (varies) | Jan-Apr | Sep-Feb |
| County/Local | Varies (often Jul-Jun or Jan-Dec) | 3-4 months before FY | Check each |

### Procurement Vehicles

Know which contracts are available in your territory:

- **NASPO ValuePoint** — multi-state cooperative
- **State-specific contracts** — check each state's procurement portal
- **E-Rate** (K-12) — application window typically Nov-Mar
- **HBCU/MSI grants** — higher ed specific funding
- **ARPA/stimulus** — check for remaining allocations
- **SLED-specific GWACs** — varies by state

### Trigger Events

Watch for these — they create urgency:

- Cyber incidents (breach, ransomware) at a peer institution
- New compliance requirements (state legislation, CISA directives)
- Leadership changes (new CIO/CISO = new priorities)
- Contract expirations (incumbent renewals = competitive opportunities)
- Bond measures or budget increases
- Consolidation (districts merging, shared services initiatives)
- E-Rate filing deadlines
- Audit findings

## Prospecting Playbook

### SLED-Specific Approaches

1. **Public records** — budgets, RFPs, board minutes are public. Use them.
2. **Conferences** — State IT conferences, EDUCAUSE, NLC, etc. Be there.
3. **Peer references** — "Your neighbor district just deployed FortiGate..."
4. **Incumbent pain** — renewal time is your best time to prospect
5. **Compliance angle** — new mandates create urgency you can't manufacture
6. **Channel partners** — who has existing relationships you can leverage?

### Prospecting Metrics

Track weekly:

| Activity | Target | Actual |
|----------|--------|--------|
| New outbound emails | 20-30 | |
| Follow-up emails | 15-20 | |
| Phone calls / voicemails | 15-20 | |
| LinkedIn touches | 10-15 | |
| Meetings set | 3-5 | |
| Meetings held | 3-5 | |
