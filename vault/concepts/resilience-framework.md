# A Practical Resilience Framework

## Not Self-Help. Just What Works.

This isn't about manifesting abundance or finding your chakra alignment. This is about surviving Tuesdays. The framework comes from real experience — sales, family, life — not from someone who meditates in Bali full-time.

## The Three-Layer Model

### Layer 1: Survive
**Goal:** Don't make it worse. Just get through.

When shit hits the fan, the first job is survival:
- Don't make permanent decisions from temporary emotions
- Do the next right thing (just one thing)
- Protect sleep, food, and basic function
- It's okay to be on autopilot temporarily

**The Sales Parallel:** When the pipeline is dry, you don't reinvent your entire strategy. You make 10 more calls. Activity over strategy when you're in survival mode.

### Layer 2: Stabilize
**Goal:** Build a floor. Create routine. Stop the bleeding.

Once you're not in freefall:
- Identify what's actually in your control (usually less than you think)
- Create small daily anchors (coffee, workout, walk, 5 min with kids)
- Talk to someone (not social media — an actual human)
- Limit decisions to reduce cognitive load

**The Sales Parallel:** After a bad quarter, you don't chase 50 new prospects. You focus on your best 10 accounts. Narrow the focus, deepen the effort.

### Layer 3: Grow
**Goal:** Extract the lesson. Use it.

This is the part self-help books skip to. You can't grow until you've survived and stabilized:
- What did this teach you?
- What would you do differently?
- How did it change what matters to you?
- Who showed up for you? (Remember that.)

**The Sales Parallel:** Post-mortem on the lost deal. Not to beat yourself up, but to win the next one.

## Practical Tactics

### The "10-10-10" Test
When facing a hard decision:
- How will I feel about this in **10 minutes**?
- How about in **10 months**?
- What about **10 years**?

Most of what stresses us out daily doesn't matter at the 10-year mark.

### The Stoic Filter
From Marcus Aurelius (who was basically a Roman Territory Account Manager for the whole empire):

> *"You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."*

Applied version: **What happened** isn't optional. **Your response** is.

### The "Worst Case, Then What" Exercise
1. What's the absolute worst case?
2. Could you survive it? (Almost always yes.)
3. What would you do next?
4. Okay, so it's survivable. Now stop catastrophizing.

### The Input/Output Audit
When life feels overwhelming:
- **What am I consuming?** (News, social media, other people's drama)
- **What am I producing?** (Work, connection, creative output)

If input > output, you'll feel anxious. Shift the ratio.

## What Resilience Actually Looks Like

It's not:
- ❌ Never feeling bad
- ❌ Pushing through everything with brute force
- ❌ "Just think positive"
- ❌ Being numb to hard things

It is:
- ✅ Feeling the hard thing and functioning anyway
- ✅ Knowing when to push and when to rest
- ✅ Getting back up one more time than you get knocked down
- ✅ Asking for help without shame

## The Book Connection

"Life is Fucking Hard" is essentially this framework expanded into stories. Every chapter is a different angle on the same truth: it's hard, and you survive it, and sometimes it makes you better. No guarantees on the "better" part. But survival? That's something you can learn.
