# Discovery Questions Framework

Deep-dive questions organized by category. Don't ask all of these — pick the ones that matter for each conversation. Listen more than you talk.

---

## Opening / Situation

Start broad, get them talking. The first 5 minutes set the tone.

- "Walk me through your current network/security setup."
- "What's keeping you up at night right now?"
- "What prompted this conversation today?"
- "How did you end up in this role?" (builds rapport, reveals experience level)
- "What does success look like for your team this year?"
- "What's changed in your environment in the last 12 months?"

---

## Current State

Understand what they have before you talk about what they need.

### Infrastructure
- "What's your current firewall/security stack?"
- "How old is your current infrastructure? When does the current contract expire?"
- "On-prem, cloud, or hybrid? Where's the trend heading?"
- "How many locations/sites are we talking about?"
- "How's your team structured for managing this? How many people?"
- "What are you doing for SD-WAN today?"
- "How are you handling remote access / VPN?"
- "What does your wireless and switching environment look like?"
- "Are you doing any OT/IoT security? Any connected building systems, HVAC, cameras?"

### Pain Points
- "Where does your current solution fall short?"
- "What would you change if you could wave a magic wand?"
- "What takes more time than it should?"
- "Where do you feel most exposed?"
- "What's broken that nobody talks about?"
- "How confident are you in your ability to detect a breach today?"
- "How long does it take to onboard a new site?"

### Past Attempts
- "Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?"
- "What vendors have you looked at?"
- "What worked? What didn't?"
- "Is there a reason the previous project stalled?"

---

## Future State

Where do they want to be? This is where you discover the real opportunity.

- "If we're sitting here a year from now, what needs to be different?"
- "What are your top 3 initiatives for this fiscal year?"
- "What does 'good enough' look like vs. 'great'?"
- "If budget weren't a constraint, what would you build?"
- "Are you looking at consolidating vendors? Why or why not?"
- "Where do you see your network in 3-5 years?"

---

## Impact / Business Case

Why does this matter? This drives urgency and executive buy-in.

- "What happens if you don't solve this?"
- "How does this affect your end users / constituents / students?"
- "What's the cost of the status quo?"
- "Has this issue caused any incidents? How recently?"
- "How does this affect your team's workload?"
- "Has your organization experienced a breach or ransomware event? How did that shape your thinking?"
- "What would a security incident cost your organization — not just dollars, but reputation, public trust?"
- "Is this affecting your cyber insurance premiums or renewability?"

---

## Decision Process

How do they buy? This is CRITICAL in SLED. Procurement drives everything.

### Stakeholders

### Process
- "Do you need to go through formal procurement / RFP?"
- "Is there a state contract or cooperative you can leverage?"

## Competition

Know the landscape. Don't be afraid to ask directly.

- "Have you used [competitor] before? How was that experience?"
- "What would make you choose them over us?"
- "Is there an incumbent vendor with a renewal coming up?"

## Closing Questions

End with clarity. Always know the next step before you hang up.

- "What would need to be true for this to move forward?"
- "What's the single biggest obstacle to getting this done?"
- "What did I not ask that I should have?"
- "What's the best next step from here?"
- "Who else should I be talking to?"
- "Can we get the next meeting on the calendar right now?"
- "Is there anything that could kill this deal that we haven't discussed?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how likely is this project to get funded? What would make it a 10?"

## Pro Tips

**Listen more than you talk.** Aim for 70/30 them vs. you. If you're talking more than 30%, you're pitching, not discovering.

**Follow the thread.** When they say something interesting, dig deeper: "Tell me more about that." Don't jump to the next question on your list.

**Silence is powerful.** Don't rush to fill it. Let them think. The best insights come after a pause.

**Take notes verbatim.** Write down exact phrases they use — you'll use those in your proposal. "You said your biggest concern is X" is more powerful than "I think your concern is X."

**Summarize back.** "So if I'm hearing you right, the main issues are X, Y, and Z?" This shows you listened and confirms alignment.

**Map the org chart.** After every meeting, sketch who reports to whom and who has influence. This saves you from getting stuck with a champion who can't buy.

**The real answer is two questions deep.** Their first answer is the polite one. The second question gets you the real pain.

**Ask about failures.** "Have you tried to solve this before? What happened?" tells you more about the buying process than any other question.

**Know when to stop.** If you've been asking questions for 40 minutes and they're looking at the clock, pivot to value. Discovery is a process, not a single meeting.

*The goal of discovery: understand their world better than their current vendor does.*
