# E-Rate 101 & Prospecting Playbook

## The Core Truth
E-Rate is not reactive selling. If you wait for a Form 470, you're already late. Winning happens 6-12 months earlier.

## The 18-24 Month Cycle
1. **Pre-Planning (Spring → Fall)** — The ONLY window for influence
2. **Competitive Bidding (Form 470)** — Hands off, 28-day minimum
3. **Vendor Selection & Contracting**
4. **Funding Request (Form 471)**
5. **PIA Review** — Can last months
6. **FCDL** — Approval
7. **Service Delivery & Invoicing**

## What Wins
- Prior experience with the district
- Technical qualifications
- Early preference positioning
- **Cost is NOT the only factor**

## The SAT Door Opener
Security Awareness Training → Security posture review → Pre-470 positioning.
**SAT is the permission slip, not the deal.**

## Key Metrics
- Conversations before October
- Inclusion in planning discussions
- Early preference positioning

## Final Line
**Early = influence. Late = compliance. Compliance doesn't win deals.**
