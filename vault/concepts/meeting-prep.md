# Meeting Prep Checklist

Quick prep framework before any SLED meeting. 15 minutes max.

---

## Before the Meeting (T-1 day)

### Account Research
- [ ] Review account in Salesforce (recent activity, open opps, last contact)
- [ ] Check their website for recent news/press releases
- [ ] LinkedIn check on attendees (role, tenure, posts)
- [ ] Any RFPs or public procurement notices?
- [ ] Current Fortinet footprint (what do they have already?)

### Stakeholder Mapping
- [ ] Who's the decision maker vs. influencer?
- [ ] Technical buyer vs. economic buyer?
- [ ] Any champions or blockers identified?
- [ ] Who else should be in this meeting but isn't?

### Context Questions
- [ ] Why are we meeting NOW? What triggered this?
- [ ] What's their fiscal year end?
- [ ] Any known pain points or initiatives?
- [ ] Competitor presence?

---

## Day-Of (T-30 min)

### Logistics
- [ ] Meeting link works / directions confirmed
- [ ] Demo environment tested (if applicable)
- [ ] Relevant case studies/collateral pulled
- [ ] Backup phone number if tech fails

### Mental Prep
- [ ] What's my ONE goal for this meeting?
- [ ] What do I want them to DO after we hang up?
- [ ] What questions do I NEED answered?
- [ ] What's my opening hook?

## Meeting Structure (60 min)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-5 | Rapport, agenda confirm |
| 5-20 | Discovery (mostly THEM talking) |
| 20-40 | Solution discussion / demo |
| 40-50 | Objection handling |
| 50-60 | Next steps, calendar the follow-up |

**Golden Rule:** If you're talking more than 40% of the time, you're doing it wrong.

---

## Post-Meeting (T+1 hour)

- [ ] Send recap email with next steps
- [ ] Update Salesforce notes
- [ ] Schedule follow-up action
- [ ] Debrief: What went well? What do I wish I'd asked?

---

## Quick Reference: SLED-Specific Angles

### State Accounts
- Reference state contracts they can leverage
- Mention other agencies in their state using Fortinet
- Compliance: CJIS, state data privacy laws

### Local Government
- Emphasize TCO and budget efficiency
- Talk about consolidation (do more with less)
- Reference peer cities/counties

### K-12 Education
- CIPA compliance, E-Rate funding eligibility
- Student safety, content filtering
- Remote learning security (still relevant)

### Higher Ed
- Research network needs (high bandwidth, segmentation)
- Student data protection (FERPA)
- Multi-campus architecture
