# Writing a Book (While Having a Life)

## The Reality

You have a full-time sales job. Two kids. A fiancé. Three dogs. A life.

The people who write books in 30-day sprints either don't have any of that or they're lying about the timeline. Here's what actually works for someone with a real life.

## The Math

- **Target:** 55,000 words
- **Daily goal:** 500 words (about 20-30 minutes of writing)
- **Timeline at 500/day:** ~110 writing days
- **Realistic pace** (writing 4-5 days/week): ~6 months

500 words is one long email. You write those at work every day. This is doable.

## What Works

### 1. Capture Over Compose
Don't sit down to "write the book." Sit down to capture a story, a thought, a scene. The book gets assembled later.

Use the toolkit: `python3 writer.py capture "Your idea here"`

### 2. The Shitty First Draft
Anne Lamott's advice is gospel: write the terrible first version. Don't edit while writing. Don't judge while creating. Just get it down. Every sentence you write, no matter how bad, is one sentence closer to done.

### 3. Voice Memos > Typing
Some of the best material will come from talking, not typing. Record voice memos while driving, walking the dogs, or just thinking out loud. Transcribe later (or have Paul do it).

### 4. Write From the Scars
"Write what you know" is too vague. Write what hurt. Write what's funny because it's true. Write the stuff you'd say at the bar but never put in an email. That's your authentic voice. That's the book.

### 5. The 500-Word Minimum
The goal isn't 500 words. The goal is *sitting down*. Once you sit down, you usually write more. But on the days when 500 is all you've got, 500 is enough. It's 500 more than zero.

## Structure Strategy

### The "Conversation" Approach
Each chapter reads like a long conversation with a friend:
- Open with a story or moment
- Dig into what it means
- Connect it to the broader theme
- Close with insight (not advice — insight)

### Voice Consistency
- First person, present tense for stories
- Profanity where it's natural, not where it's forced
- Humor as defense mechanism (because that's real)
- Vulnerability as the punchline (the joke turns serious)

## Common Traps

1. **Perfectionism disguised as research** — Stop reading other people's books and write your own
2. **Waiting for inspiration** — Inspiration comes from writing, not the other way around
3. **Editing too early** — Draft first, judge later
4. **Comparing to published work** — Published books had editors. Your draft won't look like that. That's fine.
5. **Guilt about not writing** — Some weeks are brutal. Miss a day, miss a week. Come back. The book will wait.

## Publishing Paths

### Traditional Publishing
- Needs a literary agent → needs a book proposal (not the whole book)
- Book proposal = 50-80 pages (overview, chapter summaries, sample chapters, author platform)
- Timeline: 12-18 months from signed deal to bookstore
- Pros: credibility, distribution, advance payment
- Cons: slow, loss of control, gatekeepers

### Self-Publishing
- Full control over content, cover, pricing, timeline
- Platforms: Amazon KDP (print + ebook), IngramSpark (wider distribution)
- Need to invest in: professional editing, cover design, formatting
- Timeline: whenever you want
- Pros: speed, control, higher royalty per book
- Cons: all marketing on you, no advance, perceived credibility gap (shrinking)

### Hybrid
- Work with a company that provides publishing services for a fee
- Somewhere between traditional and self-pub
- Variable quality — research carefully

**Recommendation:** Write the book first. Decide on publishing path when you have 80% of the manuscript. The writing doesn't change based on the path.
