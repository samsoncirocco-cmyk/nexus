# Objection Handling Guide

Common objections in SLED sales and how to handle them. Remember: objections mean they're engaged.

---

## Framework: LAER

1. **Listen** - Let them finish. Don't interrupt.
2. **Acknowledge** - Show you heard them. ("That's a fair concern...")
3. **Explore** - Ask a clarifying question.
4. **Respond** - Then address it.

---

## Price & Budget Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Explore:** "Too expensive compared to what?"

**Responses:**
- "Let's look at TCO over 3-5 years. When you factor in [consolidation / reduced management overhead / avoided incidents], the math often flips."
- "What's the cost of a breach or significant downtime? Our customers typically see..."
- "Would it help if we looked at phasing this over multiple fiscal years?"

### "We don't have budget"

**Explore:** "Is this a 'no budget now' or 'no budget ever'?"

**Responses:**
- "When does your fiscal year start? Let's plan for next cycle."
- "Sometimes security projects get emergency funding after incidents. Obviously we'd rather be proactive, but it's good to have a plan ready."
- "Are there grants or federal funding you could tap? (E-Rate, CARES Act successors, state cyber grants)"
- "If budget appeared tomorrow, would you move forward? If yes, let's get the technical validation done now so you're ready."

### "We need to go to bid / RFP"

**Response:** "Absolutely, that's standard for SLED. Here's what we can do:
- I'll get you the specs and compliance documentation you need.
- We can do a POC before the RFP so you have real data.
- Are you on any state contracts that might streamline this?"

## Timing Objections

### "Not right now / bad timing"

**Explore:** "What's making the timing tough?"

**Responses:**
- "I get it. What would need to change for this to become a priority?"
- "Would it make sense to at least get the discovery done so you're ready when timing improves?"
- "When should I circle back? I'll put it on the calendar."

### "We just bought [competitor product]"

**Explore:** "How's that working for you so far?"

**Responses:**
- "Makes sense. When's that contract up for renewal?"
- "A lot of our customers run us alongside [competitor] initially, especially for specific use cases like..."
- "Would it be helpful to stay in touch so we can support your next evaluation?"

---

## Technical Objections

### "We're a [Cisco / Palo Alto / CrowdStrike] shop"

**Response:** "A lot of our best customers started the same way. The question isn't usually 'rip and replace'—it's 'where are the gaps?' Have you looked at where Fortinet could complement what you have?"

### "Your product doesn't do X"

**Explore:** "Tell me more about what you need from X."

**Responses:**
- "Let me check with our SE. Sometimes there's a feature that does exactly that, or a workaround."
- "That's good feedback. Is X a dealbreaker, or more of a nice-to-have?"
- "Would a product roadmap discussion help? I can bring in our product team."

### "We've had issues with Fortinet before"

**Explore:** "What happened? I want to understand."

**Responses:**
- "I appreciate you telling me. That's not the experience we want anyone to have."
- Acknowledge specific issue, explain what's changed if applicable.
- "Would you be open to a fresh conversation? I'd hate for a past experience to cost you the right solution."

---

## Competitive Objections

### "We're looking at [competitor] too"

**Response:** "Good—you should. What do you like about their approach?"

Then:
- Address their specific strengths honestly
- Pivot to Fortinet differentiators (see competitive.md)
- Suggest a bake-off or POC

### "[Competitor] is cheaper"

**Explore:** "Are we comparing apples to apples? What's included in their quote?"

**Response:** "I'd be surprised if we're significantly more expensive for the same scope. Let me do a side-by-side with you. Often there are hidden costs in [licensing / support / required add-ons]."

### "Gartner/Forrester ranked them higher"

**Response:** "Analyst reports are one input. The better question is: which solution fits YOUR environment? I'd put our SLED references up against anyone. Want me to connect you with similar agencies running Fortinet?"

---

## Trust / Relationship Objections

### "We've worked with [competitor rep] for years"

**Response:** "Loyalty matters—I respect that. I'm not asking you to burn that relationship. I'm just asking: when's the last time you evaluated other options? You might confirm you've got the best deal, or you might find something better."

### "We need to think about it"

**Explore:** "Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?"

**Response:** "Happy to give you space. Before I go—is there anything I can clarify or provide that would help your thinking? And when should I follow up?"

### "Send me some information"

**Explore:** "Sure—what specifically would be most useful?"

**Response:** "I'll send that over. But I've found that a 15-minute call is worth more than 50 pages of PDFs. Can we schedule a quick follow-up after you've had a chance to review?"

---

## SLED-Specific Objections

### "We have to use the state contract vendor"

**Explore:** "Is Fortinet on your state contract? Let me check..."

**Response:** "Actually, we're on [contract name]. And even if you prefer another contract vehicle, there's often flexibility for evaluated alternatives."

### "Our IT staff doesn't have capacity"

**Responses:**
- "That's exactly why consolidation matters. Managing 5 point solutions takes more time than one integrated platform."
- "Would a managed services conversation help? We have partners who can handle day-to-day operations."
- "What if the solution actually reduced your team's workload?"

### "We need board/council approval"

**Response:** "What does that process look like? Can I help prepare materials? Sometimes an ROI analysis or peer reference makes those conversations easier."

---

## Mindset Tips

**Objections aren't rejection.** They're engagement. A flat "not interested" is worse.

**Don't be defensive.** Stay curious and calm.

**Sometimes the answer is no.** That's fine. Leave the door open and stay in touch.

**Document objections.** Patterns tell you what to address earlier next time.

**Ask for the real objection.** "Is there anything else holding you back?"

*Every objection is a door. Your job is finding the key.*
