# Pipeline Stage Playbook

A practical guide for what to do at each stage of the SLED sales cycle.

---

## Stage 1: Prospect / Identify (0-10%)

**Goal:** Determine if there's a real opportunity worth pursuing.

### Actions
- [ ] Research the account (budget, current vendors, recent incidents, upcoming projects)
- [ ] Identify the right contacts (IT Director, CISO, CTO, Procurement)
- [ ] Check state contract status (are we on their vehicle?)
- [ ] Look for trigger events (breaches, audits, budget cycles, leadership changes)
- [ ] Send initial outreach (use email templates)

### Exit Criteria
- ✅ Identified a potential need or pain point
- ✅ Have at least one responsive contact
- ✅ Basic qualification done (budget, authority, need, timeline)

---

## Stage 2: Qualify / Discover (10-25%)

**Goal:** Understand the real problem and whether we can solve it better than alternatives.

### Actions
- [ ] Conduct discovery call (use discovery questions framework)
- [ ] Map the decision process (who decides, who influences, who blocks)
- [ ] Understand timeline and budget source (operating vs. capital, grants, E-Rate)
- [ ] Identify the champion (who wants this to happen internally)
- [ ] Research competitive landscape (who else are they talking to?)
- [ ] Document everything in CRM

### Questions to Answer
1. What specific problem are they trying to solve?
2. What happens if they do nothing?
3. Who else is involved in the decision?
4. Is there budget allocated or does it need to be found?
5. What's the procurement process?

### Exit Criteria
- ✅ Clear understanding of pain/need
- ✅ Decision process mapped
- ✅ Budget confirmed or credible path to budget
- ✅ Champion identified
- ✅ Timeline established

---

## Stage 3: Solution / Demo (25-50%)

**Goal:** Prove we can solve their problem and differentiate from competitors.

### Actions
- [ ] Prepare tailored demo / presentation (not generic!)
- [ ] Address specific use cases they mentioned in discovery
- [ ] Include relevant SLED references (similar districts, cities, agencies)
- [ ] Propose a proof-of-concept if appropriate
- [ ] Engage SE (Systems Engineer) for technical deep-dive
- [ ] Send follow-up summary with next steps

### SLED-Specific Considerations
- Reference peer organizations they know
- Address compliance requirements (CJIS, FERPA, HIPAA as applicable)
- Show the "security fabric" consolidation story (budget-friendly)
- Highlight training resources (NSE program)

### Exit Criteria
- ✅ Solution presented and well-received
- ✅ Technical validation started or completed
- ✅ Champion actively selling internally
- ✅ Next steps agreed upon

---

## Stage 4: Proposal / Negotiate (50-75%)

**Goal:** Present pricing and navigate procurement to a decision.

### Actions
- [ ] Submit formal proposal/quote
- [ ] Review pricing with manager (discount approval if needed)
- [ ] Prepare business case / ROI justification for budget holders
- [ ] Address any remaining objections (use objection handling guide)
- [ ] Confirm procurement vehicle (state contract, RFP, sole-source justification)
- [ ] Identify and preempt any last-minute blockers

### Negotiation Tips for SLED
- Lead with value, not discount
- SLED customers respect "fair price" more than "lowest price"
- Multi-year deals can unlock better pricing AND budget predictability for them
- Bundle services (support, training) to increase perceived value
- If they need board/council approval, help your champion build the internal pitch

### Exit Criteria
- ✅ Proposal delivered and reviewed
- ✅ Pricing agreed or in final negotiation
- ✅ Procurement process underway
- ✅ No unresolved objections

---

## Stage 5: Close / Win (75-100%)

**Goal:** Get the PO and set up for a successful implementation.

### Actions
- [ ] Confirm all approvals obtained (board, council, procurement)
- [ ] Process PO through channel partner
- [ ] Schedule implementation kickoff
- [ ] Introduce customer to support/TAM resources
- [ ] Send thank-you and confirm next steps
- [ ] Update CRM — CLOSED WON 🎉
- [ ] Plan for expansion/renewal from day one

### Post-Close (Critical)
- [ ] Implementation check-in at 30/60/90 days
- [ ] Ask for reference/testimonial when appropriate
- [ ] Identify expansion opportunities (other departments, additional products)
- [ ] Add to "happy customer" list for future case studies

---

## Stage: Closed Lost

**Not a failure — it's data.**

### Actions
- [ ] Document why we lost (honest assessment)
- [ ] Thank the contacts for their time
- [ ] Set a future follow-up reminder (6-12 months)
- [ ] Share competitive intel with team
- [ ] Keep the relationship warm

### Win-Back Triggers
- Incumbent has a support failure
- Budget cycle resets
- New leadership joins
- Security incident
- Requirements change

## Pipeline Hygiene Rules

1. **Update stages weekly** — stale pipeline = bad forecasting
2. **If nothing's happened in 30 days, it moved backward** — adjust the stage
3. **Close dates should be realistic** — not aspirational
4. **Dead deals stay in CRM** — tag them, set follow-ups, mine them later
5. **Commit means commit** — only put deals in forecast when you'd bet money on them
