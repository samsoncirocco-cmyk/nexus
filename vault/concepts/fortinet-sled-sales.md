# Fortinet SLED Sales

## What SLED Actually Means

SLED = State, Local government, and Education. It's a massive market segment for cybersecurity because:

- **State agencies** manage critical infrastructure and citizen data
- **Local governments** (cities, counties) run everything from police dispatch to water treatment
- **K-12 and higher ed** have huge networks, tons of users, and limited budgets

Every one of these organizations is a target. And most of them are underfunded for security.

## The Fortinet Angle

Fortinet's strength in SLED comes down to a few things:

### 1. Security Fabric
The integrated platform story resonates here. SLED orgs don't have 50-person security teams to manage 20 different vendors. They need solutions that work together out of the box.

### 2. Price Performance
Budget-constrained buyers care about TCO. Fortinet's custom ASIC chips (SPUs) deliver better price-performance than competitors running on generic hardware. When you're pitching to a county IT director with a tight budget, this matters.

### 3. Contract Vehicles
SLED buying is all about procurement vehicles:
- **State contracts** - Each state has its own
- **NASPO ValuePoint** - Multi-state cooperative purchasing
- **E-Rate** - Federal funding program for K-12 and libraries
- **SLED-specific pricing** - Discounts and programs designed for the segment

## The Day-to-Day

Territory management in SLED means:

- **Relationship building** - These buyers value trust and long-term partnerships
- **Partner ecosystem** - Working with VARs and distributors who know the local landscape
- **Budget cycles** - Government fiscal years drive everything (end of June for states, varies for local)
- **Compliance** - CJIS, FERPA, HIPAA depending on the vertical
- **Long sales cycles** - Government procurement is slow. Pipeline management is everything.

## Challenges

1. **Budget constraints** - Always. Government never has enough money for security.
2. **Procurement bureaucracy** - RFPs, bid processes, sole-source justifications
3. **Political dynamics** - Elected officials, appointed IT directors, shifting priorities
4. **Legacy infrastructure** - Some agencies are running stuff from 2010
5. **Staff turnover** - Key contacts change with administrations

## What Makes a Great SLED Rep

- Patience for long cycles
- Ability to translate technical into business value
- Strong partner relationships
- Understanding of how government funding works
- Persistence without being pushy
- Genuine interest in helping secure public infrastructure

## The Bigger Why

At the end of the day, securing SLED isn't just about hitting quota. These organizations protect:
- Student records
- Law enforcement data
- Critical infrastructure (water, power, transportation)
- Citizen personal information
- Election systems

When you help a school district or city government get better security, you're actually protecting real people. That's not nothing.
