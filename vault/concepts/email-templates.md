# Email Templates

Copy-paste starting points. Customize for each prospect — nobody likes generic outreach.

---

## Initial Outreach

### Cold Intro (Short)

```
Subject: Quick question about [Agency/District] security

Hi [Name],

I work with [similar agency type] across [state/region] on their network security.

Quick question: Is [specific challenge, e.g., "firewall consolidation" / "securing remote sites" / "CJIS compliance"] on your radar for this fiscal year?

If so, worth a 15-minute conversation. If not, no worries — I'll leave you alone.

[Your name]
```

### Cold Intro (With Trigger)

```
Subject: Saw [news item] - quick thought

Hi [Name],

Noticed [specific news: new CIO hire, budget announcement, ransomware incident in similar agency, etc.].

We've helped [similar organizations] navigate [related challenge], and I thought it might be relevant for [Agency].

Worth a quick call to see if there's a fit?

[Your name]
```

### Referral Intro

```
Subject: [Referrer name] suggested we connect

Hi [Name],

[Referrer] mentioned you're looking at [project/challenge] and thought we should talk.

We worked with their team on [brief relevant project], and it sounds like you might be dealing with similar challenges.

Do you have 15 minutes this week or next?

[Your name]
```

### After a Conference / Event

```
Subject: Good talking at [Event Name]

Hi [Name],

Enjoyed meeting you at [event] — your comment about [specific thing they said] stuck with me.

I'd love to continue that conversation, especially around [relevant topic]. A lot of [similar orgs] are dealing with the same thing, and I think there's some value I could share.

Worth 15 minutes next week?

[Your name]
```

## Follow-Up Sequences

### After No Response (Day 3-5)

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up. I know you're busy.

Quick yes/no: Is [topic from original email] something you're working on?

If not, I'll stop bugging you.

[Your name]
```

### After No Response (Day 10-14)

```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a couple times — I'll assume the timing isn't right.

I'll check back in [3-6 months / next fiscal year] unless you tell me otherwise.

In the meantime, if anything changes, you know where to find me.

[Your name]
```

### Breakup Email (Final)

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've tried to reach you a few times without luck. No hard feelings — I know you're swamped.

I'm going to assume this isn't a priority right now and close this out on my end.

If things change down the road, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to help.

Take care,
[Your name]
```

## Meeting-Related

### Meeting Request

```
Subject: 15 min: [Topic]

Hi [Name],

Would you have 15-20 minutes this week to discuss [specific topic]?

I've been working with [similar organizations] on [relevant challenge] and have some ideas that might apply to [Agency].

Here's my calendar: [link] — or just reply with a couple times that work.

[Your name]
```

### Pre-Meeting Confirmation

Hi [Name],

Looking forward to our call tomorrow at [time].

## Post-Demo Follow-Up

### Technical Demo Follow-Up

```
Subject: Demo recap + next steps

Hi [Name],

Thanks for spending time in the demo today. Great questions from your team.

Here's a quick recap of what we covered:

**Key capabilities demonstrated:**
- [Feature 1 — tied to their specific pain point]
- [Feature 2 — tied to their specific pain point]
- [Feature 3 — tied to their specific pain point]

**Questions we'll follow up on:**
- [Open question 1] — I'll get you an answer by [date]
- [Open question 2] — [SE name] is pulling together the details

**What stood out to me:** Your team's question about [specific thing] tells me [insight about their environment]. That's actually something we've solved for [similar org type] — I can share more details if helpful.

**Recommended next step:** [POC / reference call / pricing conversation / deeper technical workshop]

Would [date/time] work to discuss?

[Your name]
```

### Demo Follow-Up (No Response)

```
Subject: Re: Demo recap — any thoughts?

Hi [Name],

Checking in on the demo from last week. I know evaluations take time.

Two things that might help:
1. I can connect you with [similar agency] who deployed what we showed you
2. We can set up a POC in your environment — no cost, no commitment, just real data

Either of those useful?

[Your name]
```

## Renewal Conversations

### Renewal Approaching (90 Days Out)

```
Subject: Your Fortinet renewal — let's plan ahead

Hi [Name],

Your Fortinet support/licensing renews on [date]. I wanted to get ahead of it rather than sending a last-minute invoice.

A few things worth discussing before renewal:
- Any changes to your environment since last year?
- Anything you wish you were getting more from Fortinet?
- Any new sites, users, or requirements coming up?

Sometimes renewal is the right time to look at consolidation or upgrades that actually save money long-term. Worth a quick conversation?

[Your name]
```

### Renewal with Upsell Opportunity

```
Subject: Renewal + a thought on [specific capability]

Hi [Name],

Your Fortinet renewal is coming up on [date]. Before we process it, I wanted to flag something.

Based on what I know about your environment, you might benefit from adding [specific capability: SD-WAN, FortiEDR, FortiNAC, etc.]. Here's why:

- [Specific benefit tied to their environment]
- [How it integrates with what they already have]
- [Cost context — "for $X more per year, you get..."]

I can put together a comparison showing renewal-as-is vs. renewal-with-upgrade. Often the ROI makes the upgrade a no-brainer.

Want me to run the numbers?

[Your name]
```

### Renewal at Risk (Competitive Threat)

```
Subject: Before you make a decision on renewal

Hi [Name],

I heard you're evaluating alternatives for your upcoming renewal. I respect that — it's smart to compare options periodically.

Before you make a final decision, I'd like to make sure you have the full picture:

1. **Migration cost:** Switching vendors involves more than the product cost. Training, reconfiguration, downtime, and learning curve are real.
2. **What we can improve:** If there's something about your current Fortinet experience that's frustrating, I'd rather address it than lose you.
3. **Updated pricing:** I may have room to sharpen the pencil on renewal. Let me check.

Can we get 20 minutes before you finalize? Even if you still decide to move, you'll make a more informed decision.

[Your name]
```

## Competitive Displacement

### Against Incumbent Vendor (Initial Approach)

```
Subject: A second opinion on your [Cisco/PAN/SonicWall] renewal

Hi [Name],

I work with a lot of [agency type] that are re-evaluating their [competitor] investments right now — mostly because [specific pain point: cost, management complexity, feature gaps].

I'm not suggesting you rip and replace anything. But if your [competitor] renewal is coming up in the next 6-12 months, a side-by-side comparison might be valuable.

Even if you stay with [competitor], you'll have leverage for a better deal. Worth exploring?

[Your name]
```

### Against Incumbent (After Initial Interest)

```
Subject: [Competitor] vs. Fortinet — real numbers

Hi [Name],

Following up on our conversation about your [competitor] environment. I put together a preliminary comparison:

**What you're paying [Competitor] today (estimated):**
- [Hardware/licensing cost]
- [Support/maintenance cost]
- [Management/additional tools cost]
- **Estimated 3-year total: $[X]**

**What Fortinet would look like:**
- [Consolidated solution cost]
- [Support cost]
- [Management included]
- **Estimated 3-year total: $[Y]**
- **Potential savings: $[Z] ([%])**

These are ballpark numbers — I'd need more details about your environment to get exact. But the direction is clear.

Want to dig into the details?

[Your name]
```

### Post-Competitive Win (Onboarding)

```
Subject: Welcome to Fortinet — let's make this a success

Hi [Name],

Thrilled to be working with [Organization]. Here's what happens next:

**Immediate next steps:**
1. [SE name] will schedule a design/implementation planning session
2. I'll introduce you to your partner's deployment team
3. We'll set a go-live target date

**Your key contacts:**
- Me (Account Manager): [phone/email]
- [SE name] (Systems Engineer): [phone/email]
- [Partner contact] (Implementation): [phone/email]
- Fortinet TAC: [number/portal]

**Resources:**
- Training: [Fortinet NSE training link]
- Community: [Fortinet community link]
- Documentation: [docs link]

I'm personally invested in making sure this deployment goes well. Don't hesitate to reach out for anything.

## Executive Briefing Request

### Requesting Exec Briefing (To Your Champion)

```
Subject: Thought for your CIO — executive briefing

Hi [Name],

We've been making good progress on the [project] evaluation. Before this goes to the next level, I'd like to offer an executive briefing for [CIO/CISO/Director name].

Here's what I'm thinking:
- 30-minute session (not a sales pitch — strategic discussion)
- Focused on [cybersecurity trends in SLED / consolidation strategies / risk reduction frameworks]
- I'd bring our [Regional Director / VP of SLED / CISO advisor] — someone peer-level
- We can do it at your office, our local office, or over Zoom

The goal is to give [executive] confidence that the direction your team is recommending is sound — and to hear their priorities directly.

Would you feel comfortable making that introduction? I can draft something you can forward if that helps.

[Your name]
```

### Executive Briefing Request (Direct to Executive)

```
Subject: 30-minute strategic briefing for [Organization]

[Executive Name],

I've been working with [Champion name] and your team on [project/initiative]. The work they're doing is impressive, and I wanted to connect with you directly.

I'd like to offer a 30-minute executive briefing covering:
- What we're seeing across [state/region] SLED organizations on cybersecurity
- How similar [agencies/districts] are approaching [consolidation/zero trust/compliance]
- How Fortinet's approach aligns with [Organization]'s strategic direction

This isn't a product demo. It's a strategic conversation. I'd bring [senior Fortinet leader] who works with organizations like yours across the country.

Would [date option 1] or [date option 2] work for your schedule?

Respectfully,
[Your name]
```

### Executive Briefing Follow-Up

```
Subject: Thank you — follow-up from our briefing

[Executive Name],

Thank you for your time today. I appreciate you sharing your perspective on [Organization]'s priorities.

Key takeaways from our conversation:
- [Strategic priority 1 they mentioned]
- [Strategic priority 2 they mentioned]
- [How Fortinet aligns]

**Next steps we agreed on:**
- [Action item 1]
- [Action item 2]

I'll work with [Champion name] to keep this moving. And I'm always available directly if you need anything.

Respectfully,
[Your name]
```

## Reference Customer Introduction

### Asking a Reference Customer

```
Subject: Quick favor — reference call

Hi [Reference Name],

Hope things are going well with the [Fortinet deployment/project].

I'm working with [Prospect Organization] — they're a [similar org type] looking at [similar project]. They're in evaluation mode and a peer conversation would go a long way.

Would you be willing to take a 15-20 minute call with their team? Nothing formal — just sharing your experience.

I wouldn't ask if it weren't a good fit. They're dealing with a lot of the same challenges you had before your deployment.

Let me know and I'll coordinate schedules. And as always, I owe you one.

[Your name]
```

### Introducing Reference to Prospect

```
Subject: Introduction: [Reference Name] ↔ [Prospect Name]

Hi both,

I wanted to connect you two.

**[Reference Name]** is [title] at [Organization]. They deployed Fortinet [solution] about [timeframe] ago for [use case]. They've seen [specific result — e.g., "60% reduction in management overhead" / "consolidated from 5 vendors to 1"].

**[Prospect Name]** is [title] at [Organization]. They're currently evaluating [solution] for [use case] and would love to hear about your experience.

I'll let you two take it from here. [Reference], [Prospect] might ask about [specific topic they care about] — I know you have a great perspective on that.

Thanks to both of you!

[Your name]
```

### After Reference Call (Follow-Up with Prospect)

```
Subject: How was the call with [Reference Name]?

Hi [Name],

How did the conversation with [Reference] go? Anything that stood out?

I specifically connected you because [reason — similar size, similar challenge, similar compliance needs]. I hope it was useful.

Any remaining concerns we should address? Ready to talk next steps?

[Your name]
```

## Proposal / Quote Stage

### Sending a Proposal

```
Subject: Proposal: [Project Name]

Hi [Name],

Attached is the proposal we discussed for [project].

Key highlights:
- [Highlight 1 — tied to their stated priority]
- [Highlight 2 — tied to their stated priority]
- [Investment: $X over Y years]

I've built in [any special considerations: phased approach, fiscal year timing, cooperative contract pricing, etc.].

Can we schedule 20 minutes to walk through it together? Easier than email ping-pong, and I want to make sure it addresses everything we discussed.

[Your name]
```

### Following Up on Proposal

```
Subject: Re: Proposal — thoughts?

Hi [Name],

Checking in on the proposal I sent last week.

Any questions I can answer? Anything you'd want me to adjust?

Happy to hop on a quick call if that's easier.

[Your name]
```

### Gentle Nudge on Decision

```
Subject: Where do we stand?

Hi [Name],

I want to be respectful of your time, so I'll be direct: Where are we on the [project] decision?

If there's something blocking progress — timing, budget, internal politics — I'd rather know so I can help (or get out of your way).

What do you need from me?

[Your name]
```

## SLED-Specific Templates

### E-Rate / Funding Mention

```
Subject: E-Rate eligible solutions for [District]

Hi [Name],

With E-Rate filing season approaching, I wanted to flag that Fortinet solutions are E-Rate eligible (Category 2 — internal connections).

We've helped several districts in [state] navigate the process. If you're planning your FY[XX] Form 470 applications, comparing options before you lock in specifications could save you money and get you better security.

A few things worth knowing:
- FortiGate firewalls are Category 2 eligible
- We can help with 470 product descriptions
- Several districts in [state] are using E-Rate for Fortinet — I can share examples

Worth a quick call to discuss your E-Rate strategy?

[Your name]
```

### State Contract / Cooperative Purchasing Reference

```
Subject: [State] cooperative contract pricing for Fortinet

Hi [Name],

Quick FYI: Fortinet is available through several cooperative purchasing vehicles, which means you can purchase without going through a full RFP:

- **NASPO ValuePoint** — [contract number if known]
- **OMNIA Partners** — [contract number if known]
- **Sourcewell** — [contract number if known]
- **[State-specific contract]** — [details]

If you're evaluating options for [project], using a cooperative contract could take months off your procurement timeline.

I can pull contract-specific pricing for your project if you'd like. Just need a rough scope.

Worth a conversation?

[Your name]
```

### Grant Funding Opportunity

```
Subject: Federal cyber grant — potential funding for [Project]

Hi [Name],

The [specific grant program — e.g., State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program / SLCGP] application window is [opening/open]. This could be a funding source for the [project] we discussed.

A few things to know:
- [Grant details: eligible activities, match requirements, deadlines]
- Fortinet solutions align with [specific grant requirements]
- I can help with the technology portion of the application

Several [agencies/districts] in [state] have successfully used this funding for security infrastructure. Want me to share what they did?

Time-sensitive since the deadline is [date].

[Your name]
```

### Post-Incident Outreach (Sensitive)

```
Subject: Here if you need anything

Hi [Name],

I saw the news about [incident, if public knowledge]. I know your team must be heads-down dealing with the aftermath.

I'm not going to pitch you on anything right now — just wanted to say if there's any way I can be helpful (even just connecting you with peers who've been through similar situations), I'm here.

No response needed. Just reach out if it would help.

[Your name]
```

### Incident in a Peer Organization

```
Subject: [Nearby city/district/agency] breach — a thought

Hi [Name],

You may have seen that [nearby organization] experienced [type of incident] recently. No doubt your leadership is asking questions.

If it would be helpful, I can share:
- What we're seeing in terms of attack trends targeting [SLED segment]
- How similar organizations are defending against [specific attack type]
- A quick assessment of where your current setup stacks up

Not trying to create fear — but proactive conversations are always better than reactive ones.

Happy to have a quick, informal chat whenever works.

[Your name]
```

## Tips for Better Emails

**Subject lines matter.** Keep them short, specific, and relevant to THEIR world. "[Agency Name]" in the subject line increases open rates.

**Get to the point.** First sentence should make them want to read the second. SLED people are busy.

**One ask per email.** Don't give them 5 things to respond to. One clear CTA.

**Make replying easy.** Yes/no questions, specific times, clear next steps.

**Personalize or don't bother.** Reference something real about them, their org, their state. "Dear IT Director" goes straight to trash.

**Follow up.** Most deals are won in the follow-up, not the first email. 3-5 touches minimum.

**Time it right.** Don't send at 5pm on Friday. Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am local time tends to work best. Avoid fiscal year-end crunch periods for non-urgent outreach.

**Track your cadence.** Don't email the same person 5 times in a week. Space it out. Be persistent, not annoying.

**Use your signature wisely.** Include your cell number. SLED IT people will text you when they won't email back.

*Templates are starting points, not scripts. Make them yours. If it sounds like a template, it won't work.*
