# Life is Fucking Hard

## The Concept

A book about the stuff nobody tells you. Not a self-help book full of toxic positivity and "just manifest it" garbage. An honest look at why life is hard, why that's okay, and how to keep going anyway.

## Why This Book

Because every bookshelf is full of two extremes:
1. **The hustle porn** - "Wake up at 4am, cold plunge, 10x your income"
2. **The therapy-speak** - "Honor your feelings, set boundaries, practice self-care"

Neither one captures what it actually feels like to be a real person dealing with real shit. Bills. Relationships. Career pressure. The gap between where you are and where you thought you'd be.

This book lives in the honest middle ground.

## Themes

- **The myth of having it figured out** - Nobody does. Stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel.
- **Work and identity** - When your job is more than a paycheck but less than your whole identity
- **Relationships are hard** - All of them. Family, romantic, friendships. The good ones are worth the work.
- **Money stress** - The thing everyone feels and nobody talks about honestly
- **Finding meaning** - Not in some grand cosmic sense, but in the daily grind
- **Resilience isn't pretty** - It's not motivational posters. It's getting up after getting knocked down, again.

## The Voice

Raw. Honest. Sometimes funny, sometimes heavy. Like talking to a friend who's been through some shit and doesn't sugarcoat it. Think: if David Goggins and Brené Brown had a less extreme, more relatable kid.

## Status

- **Phase**: Early writing, capturing ideas and stories
- **Tools**: Book toolkit CLI for writing prompts and quick capture
- **Goal**: Get a solid first draft, then figure out publishing

## Ideas & Fragments

*(This section will grow as ideas come in)*

- The "I should be further along by now" feeling
- Why comparison is the thief of joy AND motivation
- The Tuesday at 2pm test (if your life philosophy doesn't help on a boring Tuesday, it's useless)
- On being ambitious and tired at the same time
- The people who show up vs. the people who just talk

## Process

1. **Capture** - Quick notes when ideas hit (phone, voice memos, telling Paul)
2. **Develop** - Turn fragments into rough chapters
3. **Refine** - Edit, rewrite, get feedback
4. **Ship** - Don't let perfect be the enemy of done

*The working title says it all. Because it is. And that's the point.*
