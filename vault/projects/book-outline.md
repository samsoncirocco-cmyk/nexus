# "Life is Fucking Hard" - Book Outline

## Working Premise
Life is hard. Not news. But nobody talks about HOW to keep going when it's hard. This book does. No toxic positivity. No hustle porn. Just real stories about surviving the bullshit and occasionally thriving anyway.

**Target:** 50,000 words (~4,000-5,000 per chapter + intro/outro)
**Tone:** Honest, funny, profane, hopeful. David Sedaris meets Mark Manson.
**Voice:** Like a friend telling you the truth over beers.
**Audience:** Anyone who's been told to "just think positive" and wanted to throw something.
