## Audience

Anyone who's been told to "just think positive" and wanted to throw something. Primarily:
- Working parents in their 30s-40s
- People in high-pressure careers
- People who want honesty, not self-help platitudes

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Pick one chapter and write a complete rough draft
2. [ ] Record voice memos about real stories (capture raw material)
3. [ ] Set up a consistent writing routine (even 15 min/day)
4. [ ] Identify 3-5 core stories that anchor the whole book

## Publishing Considerations
