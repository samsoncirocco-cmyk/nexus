# February 6, 2026 — The Build Sprint

## Morning: SLED Toolkit
- Built complete SLED sales toolkit (~50KB+ across 10+ files)
- Competitive intelligence battle cards for 7 competitors
- Discovery questions framework with 100+ questions
- Email templates for every sales scenario
- Pipeline playbook, objection handling, procurement guide

## Midday: E-Rate Intelligence
- Parsed 97 E-Rate emails → 174 Form 470 leads
- Scored and ranked leads (135 hot, 83 mention Fortinet)
- Identified 9 territory matches (8 IA, 1 NE)
- Created 9 HTML draft emails for Outlook
- **Elkhorn NE** (11K students, 23 sites) — biggest deal on the board
- **Burlington Notre Dame** — SonicWall displacement opportunity

## Afternoon: Infrastructure
- NAU email OAuth2 permanently configured (GCP project tatt-pro)
- Gmail credentials updated
- Salesforce CLI authenticated
- E-Rate leads pushed to SFDC (with complications)
- Brave Search API configured
- Second Brain app deployed (Next.js + PM2)

## Evening: System Optimization
- Added Gemini 3 Pro to model fallback chain
- Bumped OpenRouter above broken OpenAI key
- Sub-agents switched to Gemini 3 Pro (save Anthropic costs)
- Built Kanban board for Second Brain (/tasks)
- Fixed PM2 crash loop (zombie process on port 3000)
- Fixed sidebar hydration error
- Fought with OpenAI Codex OAuth (Cloudflare won)
- Rebooted Windows VM to fix hung Outlook COM
- Populated Second Brain vault with 40+ pages of content

## Decisions Made
- Google credits strategy: use Gemini for sub-agents and building
- OpenRouter over OpenAI (key has no credits, Cloudflare blocks OAuth)
- Self-annealing approach: document recovery procedures so problems fix themselves

## Lessons Learned
- Heartbeats can kill long-running PTY commands — need higher timeouts
- OpenAI Codex OAuth is fragile from headless servers
- Sub-agents on DeepSeek are too slow — Gemini 3 Pro much better
- COM automation needs active desktop session (can't be headless)

*Biggest build day yet. The foundation is laid.*
