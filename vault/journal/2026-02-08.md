# February 8, 2026

## Security
- Rotated gateway auth + hook tokens
- Scrubbed hardcoded API keys from 3 source files + 11 docs
- New Anthropic API key deployed

## Second Brain Wiring (5 pages connected to BigQuery)

- Dashboard: live insights + event counts by source
- Activity Feed: unified BQ + vault timeline with source filters
- Commands: dual-mode execution (gateway or local Gemini)
- Chat: context-aware with email/calendar/tasks

## Infrastructure
- Cloudflare tunnel for gateway bridge (Vercel → local)
- Auto-logging pipeline: post-activity.sh, update-tasks.sh, deploy-brain.sh
- ISR + revalidation API for live data without redeployment
- Auto-commit triggers revalidation when vault changes

## TatT (3 builders running)
- Fixing 20 broken imports on manama/next
- Error boundaries + demo mode polish
- /pitch investor landing page
