## Feature Descriptions

### 1. 🤖 Agent Fleet Dashboard
**See your entire AI workforce at a glance.**
Know exactly what every agent is doing, which model it's running, how much it's costing you, and whether it needs your attention. No more blind spots.

### 2. 💬 Conversational Interface
**Talk to your agents like they're teammates, not terminals.**
Full chat interface with streaming responses, quick action buttons, and multi-agent thread switching. Ask questions, delegate tasks, review work — all in one conversation.

### 3. 📚 Knowledge Vault
**Your second brain actually remembers.**
Store everything that matters — account research, project docs, meeting notes, strategic frameworks — as searchable Markdown. AI-powered Q&A finds answers across your entire knowledge base instantly.

### 4. ⚡ Command Bar
**⌘K and you're in control.**
Issue commands, search documents, switch agents, or fire off tasks — all from a single keyboard shortcut. Power users ship faster when the interface gets out of the way.

### 5. 🕸️ Knowledge Graph
**See how everything connects.**
Interactive visualization that maps relationships between documents, people, accounts, and projects. Discover connections you didn't know existed. Click to explore, search to zoom.

## FAQ

### 1. What is Second Brain exactly?
Second Brain is a web-based dashboard that sits on top of your AI agent infrastructure. It gives you real-time visibility into what your agents are doing, lets you chat with them, search your knowledge base, track costs, and manage tasks — all in one beautiful interface.

### 2. Do I need to use OpenClaw?
The full agent management features work best with OpenClaw as the backend, but the knowledge vault, task board, sales pipeline, and document viewer work standalone. You can start with just the knowledge base and add agent features later.

### 3. Is my data stored in the cloud?
Your knowledge vault is stored as plain Markdown files — you own them completely. The app runs on Vercel but your vault data stays in your repository. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats.

### 4. How much does it cost?
Second Brain itself is free and open source (MIT license). You'll need API keys for the AI features (Google Gemini for Q&A, plus whatever models your agents use). Hosting on Vercel's free tier works for personal use.

### 5. Can I use it on mobile?
Yes! Second Brain is a Progressive Web App (PWA). Install it on your phone's home screen for offline access, push notifications, and a native-feeling experience. Works on iOS and Android.
