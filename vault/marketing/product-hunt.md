## First Comment — The Maker's Story

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Samson. I've been running AI agents for months — Claude for research, Gemini for drafts, GPT for quick tasks. The problem? I was managing all of it through terminal windows, Telegram messages, and config files scattered across my machine.

I kept asking: **Where is my agent right now? What model is it using? How much did that cost?** The answers lived in five different places.

So I built Second Brain — a single UI where I can see every agent working, chat with them properly, search my knowledge base, and know exactly what I'm spending. It started as a personal knowledge vault (Markdown files, Notion-style) and evolved into a full command center.

**What makes it different:**
- 🧠 Your knowledge lives as plain Markdown — no vendor lock-in
- 🤖 Real-time agent fleet dashboard with cost tracking
- ⌘ Command bar for power users (⌘K from anywhere)
- 🕸️ Knowledge graph that shows how your docs connect
- 📱 PWA — install it on your phone, works offline

It's open source (MIT), free, and built with Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind 4.

I built this for myself, but if you're running AI agents and feeling the pain of no visibility — this is for you.

Would love your feedback! What features would you want next? 🚀
