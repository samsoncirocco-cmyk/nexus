# SLED Cybersecurity Market Overview — 2026

## Market Size & Growth
- Public sector cybersecurity spending: ~$30B+ annually (growing 8-12% YoY)
- K-12 cybersecurity spending accelerating post-pandemic
- State/local governments increasing cyber budgets after high-profile attacks
- Federal grants (SLCGP, ARPA) injecting new funding

## Top Threats Targeting SLED

### Ransomware
- #1 threat to SLED organizations
- K-12 attacks increased 400%+ since 2019
- Average ransom demand for government: $200K-$500K
- Total cost including recovery: $1M-$5M+
- Cities hit: Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Oakland — all made national news

### Phishing & Social Engineering
- 90%+ of breaches start with phishing
- SLED employees are high-value targets (access to PII, financial data)
- Spear phishing targeting school superintendents and city managers

### Supply Chain Attacks
- Third-party vendor compromises (SolarWinds, MOVEit)
- SLED organizations rely heavily on managed services and SaaS
- Vendor risk management becoming a priority

### IoT/OT Threats
- Smart city infrastructure (traffic, water, utilities)
- School building management systems
- Law enforcement body cameras, evidence systems
- Medical devices in county health departments

## Budget Drivers

### Compliance Mandates
- **CJIS Security Policy** — law enforcement data protection
- **HIPAA** — county health departments, public hospitals
- **FERPA** — student data protection
- **State privacy laws** — growing in scope and enforcement
- **Cyber insurance requirements** — increasingly demanding MFA, EDR, network segmentation

### Federal Funding
- **SLCGP** (State & Local Cybersecurity Grant Program): $1B over 4 years
- **E-Rate**: Category 2 funding for K-12 network infrastructure
- **ARPA/IIJA**: Infrastructure funding with cyber components
- **CISA grants**: Targeted cybersecurity programs

### Incident-Driven Spending
- Post-breach organizations spend 3-5x more on security
- Peer incidents create "there but for the grace of God" urgency
- Board/council scrutiny after nearby attacks

## Competitive Landscape

### Market Share in SLED (Estimated)
1. **Cisco** — dominant in networking, struggling in security
2. **Fortinet** — strong growth, best TCO story, integrated platform
3. **Palo Alto Networks** — premium positioning, losing on price in SLED
4. **CrowdStrike** — endpoint leader, no network play
5. **Zscaler** — cloud security, gaining in larger state agencies
6. **SonicWall** — declining, strong in small K-12
7. **Microsoft** — "free with E5" angle, growing threat

### Trends
- **Platform consolidation** — SLED wants fewer vendors, not more
- **Cloud adoption** — hybrid is reality, not full cloud
- **Zero trust** — buzzword becoming real requirement
- **SD-WAN** — replacing MPLS at multi-site organizations
- **Managed services** — small teams outsourcing to MSSPs

## Fortinet's Position
- **Strengths:** TCO, integration, breadth, SLED references, E-Rate eligibility
- **Weaknesses:** Brand awareness vs. Cisco/Palo Alto, perceived as "value" not "premium"
- **Opportunity:** Consolidation trend plays directly to Security Fabric story
- **Threat:** Microsoft's "included in licensing" angle, CrowdStrike's brand momentum
