# Fortinet Product Stack for SLED

## Core Platform — FortiGate (NGFW + SD-WAN)

The foundation of every Fortinet deal. FortiGate is both a next-gen firewall and an integrated SD-WAN appliance.

### Models by Segment

|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| **FortiGate 70G/90G** | Small branch, small school | 2-4 Gbps | Small K-12, small municipal offices |
| **FortiGate 100F/121G** | Mid-size branch | 10-20 Gbps | Single-site schools, small agencies |
| **FortiGate 200G/201G** | Medium campus | 20-35 Gbps | Multi-building districts, county offices |
| **FortiGate 400F/401G** | Large campus/district hub | 35-70 Gbps | District core, state agency HQ |
| **FortiGate 600F/601F** | Large enterprise | 70-100 Gbps | University core, large district |
| **FortiGate 900G/901G** | Data center edge | 100+ Gbps | State data centers, large university |
| **FortiGate 3001F/3201F** | High-performance core | 200+ Gbps | Major ISDs, state backbone |
